# LittlePay
Try to fetch data from CSV file format. The data consists of whole bus trip logs. We're going to map them (tap-on & tap-off) to provide useful information.

# Limitation
1. This only handled one day trip (same date).
2. There's no maximum duration to indicate trip journey time.
3. It only records two tap types only, tap-on and tap-off.

# How to use
Open this project through your editor and simply run the Main.java class. You will see both outputs in your run command and a new file generated named "trips.csv".
